# National-Trust-Days-Out-Redesign

This project is a redesign and prototyping exercise for the National Trust Days Out mobile application. The aim of the project is to improve the user experience and incorporate ubiquitous computing principles into the app's design.

## Task

The National Trust is a UK-based organization dedicated to preserving natural beauty and historic places for the benefit of the nation. The National Trust Days Out app allows users to discover and explore various places of interest across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. However, the app's current design and features can be enhanced to provide a more effective and seamless user experience. The main goal of this project is to redesign and prototype a revised version of the National Trust Days Out app. The focus will be on improving the "Discover" feature, which helps users find remarkable heritage and natural wonders near their location.

## Technologies Used

- React Native: The mobile application will be built using React Native, a popular framework for developing cross-platform mobile apps.
- Expo CLI: Expo CLI will be used as a development tool to facilitate the creation and testing of the React Native app.

## Data Sources

The redesigned app will utilize data from the following sources:

- National Trust API: The National Trust Data sets will provide location and place-related information, including geojson location data and opening time information.
- External APIs: Other external APIs are integrated into the app to provide additional live data, such as weather and temperature information.
